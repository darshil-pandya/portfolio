#### Visualization 1: OECD

    OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2020

Generally maps are useful to compare values between different contries, but this is not a rule of thumb. In the above visualization, the colors are not helpful to get any information out of the visualization. The only helpful part in this viz. is the size of the spheres. However, if you closely look at the spheres in europe, the spheres are so closely packed together, its difficult the interpret the countries they represent. The only option is to hover over the sphere to find the information. 

#### Visualization 2: My version of OECD

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/7682280"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I modified the original viz. a little, and removed the dot representations. I replaced the dots with color hues, so that the darker hues represent higher ratios and the lighter hues represent lower. I used red color to represent the negative effect of high debt-to-gdp ration on the country. Finally, I clubbed the countries into categories so that the reader does not have to sort through a lot of different color hues. 

#### Visualization 3: Grid of line charts

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7678104"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The choice of red is consistent across the graphs, primarily because of the negative sentiment represented by the Debt-to-GDP ratio. The user should immediately understand that this is not a good thing. The grid of line charts is a great way to represent the trend of every countries Debt-to-GDP ratio across the years. It clearly provides the user with the ratio values as well as the user can compare between the different countrris at one glance. The big dot at the end of the lines is analogous to the head of the worm, which represents where the line is moving towards.

#### Visualization 3: Grid of area charts

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7682413"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This is another way of representing the same data. However, this chart is a little deceptive. A user might perceive the chart as - greater the red area, greater is the debt. However this is not entirely conrrect.

#### Visualization 3: Stacked line charts

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7688791"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This is another good alternative representation, but it is quite overwhelming for a novice reader. If the reader is used to consuming this data on a regular basis and wants all information in one go, then this can be a good representation for them. But for a new reader this chart can be an information overload and they can be lost in the data.
