# Overview

This is the writeup for the final version of my presentation page. The webpage is named "Reality Check - Plastic Pollution". It educates the user on how is plastic pollution increasing across the world. This presentation also highlights how are we managing the plastic, where is it being accumilated and how does it affect the life on earth. Finally, I  conclude using some call to action where I suggest some basic practices that can be followed by every individial as well as referencing some large organization that are doing some great work on reducing the effects of plastic pollution.

# Target Audience

This webpage is intended for audiences who are environmentally conscious, and are interested in knowing the facts of plastic pollution. These audience can be anyone from students, reserchers, policy makers, etc.

# Changes made

I received some useful suggestions duing the last crit session as well as when I presented the previous draft of some random audience.
