# Overview

This is the writeup for the final version of my presentation page. The webpage is named "Reality Check - Plastic Pollution". It educates the user on how is plastic pollution increasing across the world. This presentation also highlights how are we managing the plastic, where is it being accumilated and how does it affect the life on earth. Finally, I  conclude using some call to action where I suggest some basic practices that can be followed by every individial as well as referencing some large organization that are doing some great work on reducing the effects of plastic pollution.

# Target Audience

This webpage is intended for audiences who are environmentally conscious, and are interested in knowing the facts of plastic pollution. These audience can be anyone from students, reserchers, policy makers, etc.

# Changes made

I received some useful suggestions duing the last crit session as well as when I presented the previous draft of some random audience. Based on these feedback I made the following changes:
1. I could not find enough data for air pollution on time, so I decided to only focus on plastic pollution in oceans.
2. I updated the viz with missing value to ensure every bubble has a value in it as well.
3. I updated the charts to blend them into the background color of the page.
4. I recreated the map in flourish as it is much more visually appealing then in Tableau.
5. I added a text to highlight the top offendor nations across the world.
6. I added facts about what happens to discarded and incinerated plastics.
7. I added some images that connects with the readers and puts a greater impact on the effects of ocean pollution by plastic
8. I added some call to actions on an individual level and how can they join some larger organizations as well.


# Design Decisions
1. I chose a color them of blues to connect with the color of oceans. I also included a single color of red to highlight the serious topics.
2. Additionally, I decided to alternate between black and white backgrounds to keep the readers engaged.
3. I decided not to use too complicated charts to avoid loosing the users attention. Most of the visualizations are simple line charts and bubble chats that easily connect with common readers.
4. I decided to use some images to connect with the readers. These images are of how plastic is affecting the marine life.
5. I highlighted some text with different colors whenever I wanted to highlight a certain point.
6. I ensured that color contrast does not disappear in the background.

# Observations
While I was working throught this project, I observed the folling things about my topic:
1. The world plastic production has increased alarmingly since 1950.
2. Most of these plastics are still being incinerated, which leads to air pollution, or discarded into oceans.
3. The major source of ocean pollution comes through rivers from the land sources.
4. Developed countries like USA and Germany are some of the major offenders of OCEAN pollution.
5. There are a lot of organizations working independently to clean the OCEANS.
