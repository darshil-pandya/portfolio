#### Visualization 1: OECD

    OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2020
  </a>

Generally maps are useful to compare values between different contries, but this is not a rule of thumb. In the above visualization, the colors are not helpful to get any information out of the visualization. The only helpful part in this viz. is the size of the spheres. However, if you closely look at the spheres in europe, the spheres are so closely packed together, its difficult the interpret the countries they represent. The only option is to hover over the sphere to find the information. 

#### Visualization 2: My version of OECD

I modified the original viz. a little, and removed the dot representations. I replaced the dots with color hues, so that the darker hues represent higher ratios and the lighter hues represent lower. I used red color to represent the negative effect of high debt-to-gdp ration on the country. Finally, I clubbed the countries into categories so that the reader does not have to sort through a lot of different color hues.
