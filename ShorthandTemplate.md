# Second Draft - ShortHand

## User Research Protocol

Above is a rough draft of the Shorthand page that I am developing. I will be conducting user research with 3 different individuals to get their feedback on the story and different visualizations that I have created. Based on their feedback, I will make changes to the story and visualizations. I will be conducting the interviews with the following type of audience:
- Adults in the age group of 22 to 60 years
- Students, researchers, and environmentally conscious individuals

### Approach to identify target audience:
1. I will try to interview a couple of students from CMU, one masters and one PhD student. I would try to initially asertain how environmentally conscious they are, to understand how important this topic is for them.
2. I would also try to interview a middle aged person, who does not get much involved by environmental issues, to understand if the story relates to non-target audience.


### Interview Script
Hi, my name is Darshil and I am a student at CMU. I am conducting some research on World Pollution and trying to bring awareness among the people about how much pollution has increased over the years. To achieve this, I am building a website of different type of visualizations that can help the reader understand the seriousness and extent of the issue. I would like your 5 minutes to get some feedback on the webpage.
Can you please go through this rough draft, that includes some ideas and visualizations? I would like you to think out loud and provide your feedback for the page.

During the interview I would be sure to get response for the following questions:
1. Do you unerstand the flow of ideas on this page?
2. What does this page convey to you?
3. Can you explain what do you understand from the 1st chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
4. Can you explain what do you understand from the 2nd chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
5. Can you explain what do you understand from the 3rd chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
6. Can you explain what do you understand from the 4th chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?


### Interview:
1. Do you unerstand the flow of ideas on this page?
- Person A understood the flow of ideas, however person B and C thought there was some disconnect between the different pages. Once example that I received was "There is an abrupt change between the page of plastic and air pollution".


2. What dooes this page convey to you?
- Person A, B and C were all able to understand the central ideal of the webpage. They identified that the page was trying to highlight the impact of pollution on humans and animals. They liked the idea of closing with recommendation of how can a reader contribute to reduce pollution.


3. Can you explain what do you understand from the 1st chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- The responders liked the bubble chart representation. Person B identified a small bubble with missing value. This was a good observation and I need to work on this. Also, they thought that the cream color was not useful for reading the text inside it. They did not find the chart confusing. Once more thing that was pointed out was that it would be helpful if the circles could also show the values without hovering on them.

4. Can you explain what do you understand from the 2nd chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- The responders did not like the black and white contrast of the page. They want the chart to seamlessly integrate with the page background. 
- Person B and C liked the comparison with boeing 747 aircraft as it helped them compare the actual weight of the ocean surface plastic.
- Person A identified the small dark blue circle of boeing-747 aircraft and said that he would like it to be clearly labelled.

5. Can you explain what do you understand from the 3rd chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- The audience did not like the integration of map chart. They did not like that it was restricted by a square. They would have liked the map to be stretched across the page.
- The audience was also not able to understand the values represented in the scale. e.g. What does 0.686 represent.
- Person C said that it would be better to have some supporting text about the message you are trying to convey with this chart.
- Person A brought out a good point that said that "What is the reson of highlighting the countries if you are not conveying anything about the highest offenders?"

6. Can you explain what do you understand from the 4th chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- All the interviewees clearly understood the graph and appreciated the simplicity of the chart.
- Person C thought this was a good metric and I should use it to convey some high impact point. He said I could compare it with how much plastic per person is recycled per day and bring out a tangible analogy of the amount of waste generated.


### Changes to be implemented
I loved the inputs I received from the interviews and will implement the following changes based on them:
1. I would try to add a good transition between plastic and air polluiton
2. I will update viz 1 to correctly label the missing value. I will also try to atleast add values to the important circles.
3. I will be updating all the pages such that the chart easily blends in with the background color of the page.
4. I will try to use a better map and try to stretch it across the page. I will add an appropriate heading to the map that derives a certain point from the chart.
5. I will also try and add some insight about the top offenders of the pollution, if I can not identify it, i will replace the visualizations.
6. I will try to add some comparison point like how much plastic is recycled per day, and try to highlight the difference that shows the amount of waste generated per day.
