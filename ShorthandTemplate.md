## User Research Protocol

Above is a rough draft of the Shorthand page that I am developing. I will be conducting user research with 3 different individuals to get their feedback on the story and different visualizations that I have created. Based on their feedback, I will make changes to the story and visualizations. I will be conducting the interviews with the following type of audience:
. Adults in the age group of 22 to 60 years
. Students, researchers, and environmentally conscious individuals

### Approach to identify target audience:
1. I will try to interview a couple of students from CMU, one masters and one PhD student. I would try to initially asertain how environmentally conscious they are, to understand how important this topic is for them.
2. I would also try to interview a middle aged person, who does not get much involved by environmental issues, to understand if the story relates to non-target audience.


### Interview Script
Hi, my name is Darshil and I am a student at CMU. I am conducting some research on World Pollution and trying to bring awareness among the people about how much pollution has increased over the years. To achieve this, I am building a website of different type of visualizations that can help the reader understand the seriousness and extent of the issue. I would like your 5 minutes to get some feedback on the webpage.
Can you please go through this rough draft, that includes some ideas and visualizations? I would like you to think out loud and provide your feedback for the page.

During the interview I would be sure to get response for the following questions:
1. Do you unerstand the flow of ideas on this page?
2. What does this page convey to you?
3. Can you explain what do you understand from the 1st chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
4. Can you explain what do you understand from the 2nd chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
5. Can you explain what do you understand from the 3rd chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
6. Can you explain what do you understand from the 4th chart? Is there anything confusing about this chart? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
