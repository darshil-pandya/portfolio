## World Plastic Pollution

Plastic has become an inseparable part of human development, despite the first commercial use and large scale production is dated back to the 1950s. 
Plastic has diversified uses and consumed by a number of sectors worldwide. The principal consumer of plastics is packaging industry (consumes almost 36% of the 
total world plastic production). Interestingly, this sector is also the highest contributor in the global plastic waste production. The low cost, durability, 
easiness in processing, lightweight, high thermal, and electrical insulation has made plastic attractive for its applications ranging from food packaging to 
electrical industries.

The below chart is used by a research paper that talks about "Plastic Pollution in Bangladesh: A review on current status emphasizing the impacts on environment and public health".
This paper was published on the Environmental Engineering Research forum and it talks about the use and consumption of plastics on a global level as well. 

I was doing my research on plastic pollution and came across the below visualization (fig. 1). It took me almost 2 mins to fully understand the story behind the visualization. 
The pie chart intends to provide important information, but it is very difficult to interpretn. Hence, I thought it would be a good idea to try and improve this visualization.
