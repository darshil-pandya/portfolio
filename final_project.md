# OUR WORLD IN POLLUTION CRISIS

In this project, I will be focusing on worlds plastic pollution. I will be including sections which demonstrate the plastic consumption and waste generation by different countries and industries. I want to highlight how our plastic footprint has increased over the years and attract the attention towards, possible areas of improvement.

## Structure

1. Explaining where the world stands in terms of different types of pollution
2. Highlighting the different contributors of pollution
3. Focusing on the major factors
4. Bringing light on how the current world is coping up with pollution
5. Suggesting how evryone can contribute to combat the pollution crisis

## Data Sources:

I have picked up data from different sources. The current data source is primarily on plastic pollution. I wish to incorporate some more data on air pollution. 
I will research and add some pointers on how this pollution is directly impacting the nature and human health. 
I will try out different combinations of representations to highlight the most critical point to attract users attention with minimum effort.

### Our World in Data - Plastic Pollution

At the end of this story, I wish to attract the attention of the reader towards the growing concern of water pollution by plastic and motivate them towards taking an action 
towards solving the problem.

## Method & Medium

I will be using shorthand to build a story for my narrative. I will add different visualizations coupled with some important milestones and metrics that will put an impact on the criticality of pollution.

I will try to incorporate some data from the top organizations that are trying to combat the pollution problem and add reference links.

I will finally try to give some pointers to the readers and help them contribute towards combating the POLLUTION CRISIS.
